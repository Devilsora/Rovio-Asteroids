Rovio Challenge

Code Design
	- Fairly simple, didn't want to go overboard for a simpler game like asteroids
	- Mostly "manager" designs - having objects that manage the score, player movement, and obstacle generation vs more scattered approach.
	- Initially was thinking of using object pooling for the asteroids and the bullets, but....
			- Didn't like object pooling for asteroids (reduces variety of asteroid shapes and asteroid limit is in the game anyway)
			- Bullets aren't very processor-using heavy
	- Initially wanted to rely more heavily on SendMessage instead of keeping references, but recognized it was probably better to 
      just use references. Wouldn't be that much of an issue and the reference never gets deleted anyway.
    - Try to mitigate public variables and rely on SerializeField to edit in editor
	
Challenges
	- I don't typically use the Unity animator, but I went to use it for the player animation switch between the explosion effect and regular ship sprite. I ran into some trouble wrangling
		the animator there (had to redo animator later)
	- Fixing the player movement from using rigidbody addTorque to a smoother movement - adding torque felt too floaty and not as close to the original asteroids game as I wanted.
	- UFO movement and trying to get an accurate tracking shot from the smaller UFOs
	- Asteroid generation on the fly (rather than having sprites, create procedural meshes and assign those as asteroids so no sprites need to be made), but this didn't work out so I switched back to sprites

Decisions
	- Main decision was trying to make it similar to the Asteroids arcade game, but with some changes (so not a 100% remake).
	- Kept the asteroids on screen limit (26) since that felt like a good limit to include to prevent the screen from getting too cluttered with obstacles.
	- Dropped the shot limit (in asteroids you can only have 4 shots on screen at a time) - it feels way better to smash the spacebar to make shots.
	- Removed shots wrapping around the screen - felt busy with all of the other obstacles on screen as well, and with no shot limit it can get hectic
	- Really liked the player movement - sharp turns and a little time to actually start thrusting away.
	- Dropped the hyperspace button - felt wanting to make it more skill testing vs. relying on RNG to save yourself if needed.
	- Polygon Colliders on the sprites (except the UFOs) for collisions for more precise collisions (not remaking/regenerating colliders during gameplay anyway)
	- Originally wanted to do custom generated asteroids using Unity Mesh tools (some remnants of that are still in the project of messing with meshes, but isn't affecting the game) ,
		but didn't have enough research/experience to go off. Will definitely try to make it on my own time in the future.
